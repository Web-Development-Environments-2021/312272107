        <h3>
          I am Grandpa Andras Arato, also known as Harold.
          <br>
          <br>
          I used to work as a lighting engineer, and have already retired. 
          <br>
          <br>
          During recent years, many have embraced me as an internet meme. 
          <br>
          <br>
          They have done so because to some, my smile looks as if I'm not really happy.
          <br>
          <br>
          I chose to take advantage of that, and act as a symbol - 
          <br>
          <br>
          A symbol that proves to others they can live happilly by smiling while hiding their pain!

            <h3><u>Display three main differences between Web 1, Web 2 and Web 3 </u></h3>
            In the following answer, I will elaborate further on three major differences between Web 1, 2 and 3.
            <br/>
            <b>Firstly,</b> Web 1 was mostly consisted of readers, whilst only few content creators were active.  
            <a href = "https://harvardlawreview.org/" target="_blank">For exmaple,this website for harvard law </a>
            Web 2 has had a different vision in comparison to Web 1 and has focused in social interaction and aspires to encourage users to share
            therefore transforming many passive users to become active.
            <a href = "https://facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>
            ,
            <a href = "https://www.4chan.org/" target="_blank">4Chan</a>
            and
            <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/" target="_blank">TikTok</a>
             provide great exmaples of that. 
            <br/>
            Web 3 has taken Web 2 one step further, and has attempted to provide the user with a personal experience, by focusing on distribution of data and use of sophisticated AI and other tools.
            <br/>
            <b>Secondly</b> and to further explain the aforementioned difference, Web 1's focus was on the dissemination of information, Web 2's objective was to connect different people around the globe and Web 3's purpose was to provide widespread information to all.
            <br/>
            <b>Thirdly</b>, Web 1 was built mostly around companies that cater to consumers' needs by releasing content they can view. 
            In stark contrast to Web 1, Web 2 has shifted its focus to people, facillitating their need to share information. 
            <br/>
            During the period of Web 2, companies have started to build applications that allow users to share information with each other; e.g. YouTube, MySpace.
            <br/>
            During Web 3, rather than companies, people have begun to construct applications that make way for users to interact with each other. 
            Companies have changed their perspective and have begun to manufacture platforms in which people can offer their unique services and or content. 
            <br>
            <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo" target="_blank">For example, this site called Tivo</a>
            which provides a recording program based on personal preferences.        
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>In conclusion</b>, Web 1, 2 and 3 are massively different and so I have presented 
            <br>
            three significant differences between them.  
          </p>
          <p>

            <h3><u><br/>Explain the differences during use of Use Cases</u></h3>
            <b>Firstly</b>, a prime example would be a simple search for "harvard law".
            <br>
            Web 1 would provide links for website that displays articles of harvard educates, while Web 2 would also provide an option for feedback and perhaps sharing.
            <br>
            Web 3 may also provide different articles of American Law of other universities and colleges in the United States.  
            <br>
            <b>Secondly</b>, we shall inspect a common search of social networks. 
            <br>
            Web 1 would have most likely yielded articles that speculate how such networks should be implemented in the future, since they did not fully function during that period.
            <br>
            Web 2 would have provided the user with many different websites that may fulfil his needs, such as Facebook, Instagram or MySpace. 
            <br>
            Web 3 focuses on information and therefore provides the user with a list of different social networks to choose from, along with detailed explanations of each network. 
            <br>
            <b>Thirdly</b>, we will proceed to take a closer look at Shopping Websites.
            <br>
            Web 1 would have provided a variety of different products for the customer to choose from.
            <br>
            Web 2 will have implemented the option to comment on certain sellers or products and Web 3 would gather information on every customer in order to enable an unprecedented shopping experience for each user.
