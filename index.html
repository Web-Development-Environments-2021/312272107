        <h3>
          I am Grandpa Andras Arato, also known as Harold.
          <br>
          I used to work as a lighting engineer, and have already retired. 
          <br>
          During recent years, many have embraced me as an internet meme. 
          <br>
          They have done so because to some, my smile looks as if I'm not really happy.
          <br>
          I chose to take advantage of that, and act as a symbol - 
          <br>
          A symbol that proves to others they can live happilly by smiling while hiding their pain!

      <h3>
        Answer to first question: 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the following answer, I will elaborate further on three major differences 
        <br>
        between Web 1, 2 and 3.
        <br>
        Firstly, Web 1 was mostly consisted of readers, whilst only few content creators were active.  
        <br>
        <a href = "https://harvardlawreview.org/" target="_blank">For exmaple,this website for harvard law </a>
        <br>
        Web 2 has had a different vision in comparison to Web 1
        <br>
        and has focused in social interaction and aspires to encourage users to share
        <br>
        therefore transforming many passive users to become active.
        <br>
        <a href = "https://facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a>
        , 
        <a href = "https://www.4chan.org/" target="_blank">4Chan</a>
        and
        <a href = "https://www.tiktok.com/" target="_blank">TikTok</a>
         provide great exmaples of that. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Web 3 has taken Web 2 one step further, and has attempted to provide the user with
        <br>
        a personal experience, by focusing on distribution of data and use of sophisticated AI and other tools.
        <br>
        Secondly and to further explain the aforementioned difference, Web 1's focus was on 
        <br>
        the dissemination of information, Web 2's objective was to connect different people around the globe  
        <br>
        and Web 3's purpose was to provide widespread information to all.
        <br>
        Thirdly, Web 1 was built mostly around companies that cater to consumers' needs 
        <br>
        by releasing content they can view. 
        <br>
        In stark contrast to Web 1, Web 2 has shifted its focus to people, facillitating 
        <br>
        their need to share information. 
        <br>
        During the period of Web 2, companies have started to build applications that allow
        <br>
        users to share information with each other; e.g. YouTube, MySpace.
        <br>
        During Web 3, rather than companies, people have begun to construct applications 
        <br>
        that make way for users to interact with each other. 
        <br>
        Companies have changed their perspective and have begun to manufacture platforms 
        <br>
        in which people can offer their unique services and or content. 
        <br>
        <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiVo" target="_blank">For example, this site called Tivo</a>
          which provides a recording program based on personal preferences.        
        <br>
        In conclusion, Web 1, 2 and 3 are massively different and so I have presented 
        <br>
        three significant differences between them.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Answer to second question:
        <br>
        Firstly, a prime example would be a simple search for "harvard law".
        <br>
        Web 1 would provide links for website that displays articles of harvard educates,
        <br>
        while Web 2 would also provide an option for feedback and perhaps sharing.
        <br>
        Web 3 may also provide different articles of American Law of other universities and colleges
        <br>
        in the United States.  
        <br>
        Secondly, we shall inspect a common search of social networks. 
        <br>
        Web 1 would have most likely yielded articles that speculate how such networks
        <br>
        should be implemented in the future, since they did not fully function during that period.
        <br>
        Web 2 would have provided the user with many different websites that may fulfil his needs,
        <br>
        such as Facebook, Instagram or MySpace. 
        <br>
        Web 3 focuses on information and therefore provides the user with a list of different 
        <br>
        social networks to choose from, along with detailed explanations of each network. 
        <br>
        Thirdly, we will take a closer look at Shopping Websites.
        <br>
        Web 1 would have provided a variety of different products for the customer to choose from.
        <br>
        Web 2 will have implemented the option to comment on certain sellers or products
        <br>
        and Web 3 would gather information on every customer in order to enable an unprecedented 
        <br>
        shopping experience for each user.
